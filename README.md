# Cosmos WalletMon

Cosmos WalletMon is a simple script that helps send notifications whenever a wallet drops below a specified threshold balance. This was inspired by me always forgetting to check whether my Restake hot wallet had funds to keep auto-compounding delegate's balance.

# Usage

The easiest way to run this is using docker-compose.
